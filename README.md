# Sonic-Shadow4ever
This is a fun, interactive web application for Sonic fans. It allows users to create an account, and once logged in, they can see their user credentials and any characters they have added to their favorites. Additionally, users who aren't logged in can collect rings, quiz themselves on their knowledge of Sonic and Green Hills, and modify the Sonic characters by adding or removing characters.  
Features implemented include:

* Modified home page by adding a 'favorite' feature using hooks and Bootstrap, allowing users to add/remove a character from their favorites list (only when logged in), displayed in their user profile tab.
* Added images associated with the characters displayed on the home page
